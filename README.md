## MVP 
* Users index page with a search bar on it that when you search (a swarch feature is a form that makes a get request for people), limits to the results to the folks that match the search (react)
* user show page (react) which is also an index of accolades for that user (accolades table now needed)
* new accolade form on user show page (react) (involves twilio and charities later on)
* review people I have nominated for accolades on my own user show page (only visible to the owner of the profile maybe)

----
## MVP Part 2 
- as a person who wnats to get nominated, when I am nominated I get a text message with Twlio

- I want to see a link to share a person that I have recently nominated and given charity money on twitter OR insta

- as a person who wants to get nominated, I can use a search to find charities that I dig and want folks to give money to (we wont facilitate the money being given, the user has to navigate to the donation page)
