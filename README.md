## MVP Part 2 
- as a person who wnats to get nominated, when I am nominated I get a text message with Twlio notifying me, 
- 
- When I recieve a notification, I want to see a link to the charity the nominator chose so that I may make good on my pledge

- as a person who wants to get nominated, I can use a search to find charities that I dig and want folks to give money to (we wont facilitate the money being given, the user has to navigate to the donation page)
