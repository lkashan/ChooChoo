Choo-Choo - Your Own Personal Hype-Train

Description:
ChooCoo is pro-social empathetic engagement app based on scientific research of the relationship between generosity and happiness to facilitate a cycle of public accolades and corresponding charitable donations. Choo-Choo is designed to combat the paradigm of self-serving behavior and isolation that plagues our culture. Members of the community can send out their own personal "hype-train" of public praise and superlatives to via a user's profile page, and their positive social engagement is then correspondingly rewarded via a donation to a user' selected charity in the senderâ€™s name. Good samaritans in the community will receive a text notification when someone has sent them a hype-train, along with a link to the donation page of their charity to make good on their pledge.
